This plugin provides a shortcode to display the table of contents and reading time on all posts and pages displayed on the_content.

== Description ==

* You will be able to use a shortcode that displays the table of contents and reading time when editing articles and fixed pages.
*The table of contents is determined by the h tag in the text. The h tag to be displayed can be set on the administrator screen.
*The display hierarchy of the table of contents can be set on the administrator screen.
* Reading time is also displayed together. To hide the reading time, set the "readtime" parameter of the shortcode to 0. Default is 1.
*Reading time is automatically calculated from the amount of text in the text. This is only a guideline.
